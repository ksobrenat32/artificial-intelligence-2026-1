# Maze Solver

Write down a program that solves a maze using a simple reflex agent and, separately, a goal-based agent. The program will take a maze represented as a matrix.
The matrix will have the following values in each cell:

    1: A wall
    0: a free path
    S: The start
    M: The goal

Finally, write a report with the following sections:

    Title
    Abstract
    Goals
    Introduction
    Development
    Results
    Conclusions
    Bibliography

The program and the report will be performed in teams of four.
